                This website was made with the purpose of being a midterm project in order to test my abilities.
                I'll have to use correct syntax and structure webpages as well as adding interactive elements.
                I'll also throw in some of my own personal work on one of the pages for you to look at! I hope you enjoy!

                The works on the portpholio tab were actually made by me! I did a lott of digital art for 
                my portpholio when I did AP art just a year ago. This assignment is a convenient excuse to show
                some of the stuff I made!

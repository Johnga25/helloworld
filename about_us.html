                <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
             <p>I've lived in Winona MN my whole life.
                I grew up as a pretty closed off kid, not that I didn't have freinds but more I never went to their house
                So I spent most of my childhood absorbed into videogames, art, and most importantly the internet.
                This and some other influences are a large reason as to why I wanna learn to program. I love computers!.</p>
                
             <p>As for current me I really have been getting into different media from the past.
                Wether that means old videogames all the way from the 90s to just a decade ago, or shows that started and concluded before I existed
                I do also have a big love for horror, when someone tries to make something terrifying to them you get a look at a very deep side of them, I just love exploring that!

                <h2>My Goals for this Course</h2>
                <p>In a basic sense, I wanna learn to program! But more extensively I wanna learn how to crack into and understand computers more.
                   I wanna know how they do stuff and why, I wanna know how I can make them do stuff and create things for others.
                   But for this course that'd be just learning how to make a website!

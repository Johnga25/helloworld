            Drawing isn't that hard. <strong>Drawing well is</strong> but I'm not qualified to teach that.
            First and <em>most importantly</em>, you need a pencil and paper.
            Then think of what you want to draw. It can be anything.
            Visualize it in your mind, and break it into simmple shapes.
            Draw those shapes on the paper, and then add details.
            Finally, add shading and texture to make it look more realistic.
            And there you have it, a drawing!
            (do not take this seriously, this is incredibly abridged and simplified)
